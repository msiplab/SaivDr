* Known issues

- IMFILTER function of MATLAB R2017a has a bug with circular boundary extension mode.
  This bug affects to some classes in saivdr.dictionary.udhaar.*. 
  Please search #BUG: 1554862 on https://jp.mathworks.com/support/bugreports.

- Parallel Computing Toolbox of MATLAB R2016b has a bug on search path priority.
  This bug affects to class saivdr.dictionary.nsoltx.design.NsoltDesignFrq.
  Please search #BUG: 1446838 on https://jp.mathworks.com/support/bugreports.

- On R2017a, if PARPOOL starts automatically when MYTEST is executed,
  an error occurs in the second test of NsoltDesignerFrqTestCase.
  For now, this problem is avoided by running PARPOOL before running MYTEST.
