System object definitions for sparsity-aware image and volumetric data restoration

## Summary

SaivDr is an abbreviation of Sparsity-Aware Image and Volumetric Data Restoration. 
This package is developed for

* Experiments,
* Development and
* Implementation

of sparsity-aware image and volumetric data restoraition algorithms.

In particular, this package provides a rich set of classes related to 
[non-separable oversampled lapped transform ( *NSOLTs* )](https://sigport.org/documents/multidimensional-nonseparable-oversampled-lapped-transforms-theory-and-design) , which allows for convolutional layers with
 
* Parseval tight (paraunitary),
* Symmetric and
* Multiresolution 

properties. For some features, we have prepared custom layer classes with 
Deep Learning Toolbox. It is now easy to incorporate them into flexible 
configurations and parts of your network.

## Requirements
 
* MATLAB R2020a or later. R2021a is recommended.
 * Signal Processing Toolbox
 * Image Processing Toolbox
 * Optimization Toolbox

## Recomendation
 
 * Deep Learning Toolbox
 * Global Optimization Toolbox 
 * Parallel Computing Toolbox

 * GPU Coder

## Brief introduction
 
1. Change current directory to where this file contains on MATLAB.
2. Set the path by using the following command:

        >> setpath

3. Build MEX codes if you have MATLAB Coder.

        >> mybuild

4. Several example codes are found under the second layer directory 
   'examples' of this package. Change current directory to one under 
   the second layer directiory 'examples' and execute an M-file of 
   which name begins with 'main,' such as
 
        >> main_xxxx
 
   and then execute an M-file of which name begins with 'disp,' such as
 
        >> disp_xxxx
